## The Fall of Rhea

“Lady Rhea\!  Can you hear me?” 

She fell and fell.

Despite being identical to a human, a Bringling is not such a fragile thing for they are protected by the technologies of their ancestors. Forgotten technology that still serves them.  And it is for this reason that the perils of mortal man mean nothing to a Bringling.  They can, for instance, survive in the vacuum of space.  

And a Bringling would have nothing to fear if not for the same technology that can also take life.  That and the technology of the Gudites.  
   
Falling with the Bringlings was every type of object that you would expect to be produced from a massive space war and destruction of two planets. Everything plus Minah – Rhea’s bound Whysan companion.  Minah attempted to wake her Rhea:

“Lady Rhea\! Wake\!   Lady Rhea\!  You Must Awake\!” 

Rhea was roused by her pleas.  She opened her eyes. 

“Minah…”  She reached for her bloody temple which Minah was already soothing. 

 “I failed to kill him. And now my energy is spent.”, Rhea lamented with tears

“No, Milady, he is dead for sure.  Puck himself confirmed it.”

“Then why are we still here?” Rhea's eye’s widened.

“I cannot say.  But look\! Our world has ended\!  Look at the plight of our people\! Even now they sail into oblivion\!”

Rhea took stock of the situation.  Screaming Bringlings tumbling through the aether, fiery mountains smashing into each other, hot dust clouds and rocky spray and above all the dead… billions and billions of the dead formed this maelstrom of calamity. 

“I can’t save them as I am now.  I haven’t the power.”

“Lady Rhea…”

More pause and facing the immensity of the situation…

“It has to be ‘consumption’”

“Lady Rhea, no, it will end you in this universe\!”

“It must be done, Minah.  For I am not the destroyer of the Gud but the savior of the Bringlings… it must be done.”

With that she spoke the magic words to disable all safety from her spells:

“Eee a noh shee a no nine nin”  (see my plight , oh spectre)  
“Tay u nigh veh a zo hine nin”   (know my need,  oh spectre)  
“Kree za are tey o fa rine nin”    (respect my right, oh spectre)  
“Aug usk do fee a zo zine nin\!”   (release my power, oh spectre)

**“CON-SUMP-TION\!”**

Power surged through Rhea’s body.  From her an aura shown not a light any mortal had seen; its color could not be described and was often called the ‘hue of light’ .  To all who saw it hope returned and yet  the saying “that which burns twice as bright…”  

Rhea was no longer injured and sluggish but full of power and vigour for the moment.

Her first command granted a small portion of her power to all the living: “RE-STORE\!”

She shouted through the void of space itself “Summon they who follow\!”

Tossing Bringlings suddenly became righted in orientation and direction.  They were quickly attracted to Rhea’s position. Only a few thousand still lived.

“We have lost so many, Lady Rhea\! So Many”  
Minah’s laments did not break Rhea’s focus.  She commanded: “I call upon you Mazor\!” in a flash of light her spear ‘Mazor’ appeared.  She took it into her hands and flung it into the largest asteroid in her vicinity burying it deep inside.

Rhea commanded “Scorch my Mazor\!” – the spell was the strongest she had cast and seemed to drain her aura.

To the boulder nothing happened for a while.  Slowly little rumbles grew.  Cracks started to form on the surface and then a huge lava plume exploded, then another and another… lava started to pour all over the surface and the mountainous regions sank until the entire body was a hot ball of molten lava.

Rhea slowed her Bringling cohorts and came to orbit the tiny planetoid of lava.

“Rhea unsheathed her rapier ‘Zaphar’ which fired many tiny energy bolts from Zaphar’s point zapping nearby asteroids.  The travel of the asteroids became perturbed and they fell into the lava core.  She then commanded other capable Bringlings to do the same.

Hours passed by and the little core wasn’t so little anymore.  Rhea signaled to all to stop the bombardment and the surface cooled and aged millions of years in mere minutes.  

She bade her people be patient as she descended to the surface of the new planet landing on a muddy hill slope.

Barefoot, she took two steps on the muddy hill and reflected for a moment.  

“I call upon you Mazor\!” and Mazor rent itself from the earth with great velocity, unsettling stone and to her hand. She pricked her foot with Mazor and took one last bloody step.

She lifted her last foot, the mud underneath pulsed with a great light and was now stone…. A great rumbling started to shift everything and the foot printed embankment, now a rock was turned on its side facing a valley.  “The last steps of Rhea” she said.  “It will be for others to wash the blood of the last step”  
   
She tore from her breast a necklace set with a single wish stone.

She held the wish stone tightly and with great focus for a while trembling with energy she prayed, “I have grown tired and can no longer be your hero.  I would give you, but I have no heirs.  Return to us our ability to reproduce and flourish and in reciprocity I will surrender our immortality and my time on this plane.  Do this and a successor will be born one day and your wish will have a new and stronger hero.”

Some time passed.

The ground in front of her trembled and cracked and a great ark pushed through.  The ark was ornate with a transparent triangle on the top where from a higher view one could see the contents: clay. 

Then the stone lit the entire earth and sky with great energy and Rhea then stood atop that world with a new power.  Plumes of steam started to vent from everywhere… Clouds formed, rain fell, rock turned to soil, the air became warm and the wind gave a smell of sterile minerals to an earthen aroma. 

Plants burst from the earth at a fantastic speed filling every nook and cranny with flora.  And within the flora sounds could be heard of animals playing, fighting, mating and dying.

“I give my people new celestial bodies to light this planet, signal the seasons and preserve the core tenants of our bringling heritage.”. 

From nothing appeared a volcanic moon that spewed seas of lava and lit Rheashan like a pseudo-sun.   “Observe Mikkatra, the moon of the body.  Preserver of our martial arts.”

A second moon twice as large appeared in another hemisphere of the heavens. Upon the moon many fantastic radioactive crystals that bathed the night sky in an eerie green light.

“Laftstria – the moon of the mind. Preserver of our magical arts”

And finally a 3rd much smaller moon appeared.  Dark and reddish and too small to maintain a spherical shape. Rhea pondered this moon the longest 

“Behold Kardia. The moon of the heart.  That which we–”, her voice broke in sorrow”  failed to preserve… sent us into this hell.”  She pondered again. "Any words on this are lost, you will just have to find it yourself someday."

The ark now sat overlooking a large lake (formerly a dusty ravine).   

She swung Mazor upon the ark, splitting it down a diagonal.  The clay oozed from the broken artifact and flowed into the lake below.

“These now are the spawning grounds for our bringling people for the immortals of this world are now gone forever. Live on through your children.”

“This is–”, her voice breaks again”-- all I leave to you, my family and followers.”

“I give you my worthy Kastron cousins to rule as regents of the universe. For you have no need of a successor today, but when that day comes – for our tasks as Bringlings are not satisfied – she will be foretold by a light shone down from the great conjunction of the three moons.”

“I may see you in the previous life some day, but not again in this one.”

She then slammed Mazor’s head into the ground and turned to stone.
