# WAR’S END

A wave of energy ripped through the universe causing a chain of explosions that pocked the very fabric of space.  At its origin stood the hero and its terminus a supernova; the cosmic funeral pyre of the villain.  And with that the 2nd Gudite war ended in their defeat.

For the Bringlings It was a pyrrhic victory.  In marshaling what was needed to win they had consumed all that was their homeworld and lost it too in an explosion.  

The last Bringlings fell through space like tiny droplets of rain falling through a stratosphere.  One drop–the hero, the leader and protector of the Bringlings–fell and fell. She was gravely injured and unconscious. 

“Lady Rhea\! Wake\!   Lady Rhea\!  You Must Awake\!”
