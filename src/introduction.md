## INTRODUCTION

You have gotten to a copy of this draft and seem intent on reading it.  There's nothing i can do to stop you now.  

Don't get me wrong!  I'm actually thrilled to share with others this world that has inhabited nothing more than my own headspace for so many years.  I can't wait to get feedback and talk about the characters and world with others.

What you are about to read is a short story carved out of a much larger work. In the book Astro Battle which takes place thousands of years in the future and follows the adventures of human characters Fae & Less our heroes often encounter precursor artifacts and technology.  Precursor meaning an alien civilization that existed a million years before and has sense perished.  The Precursors are essential to the plot as it unfolds.

THIS story tells about The Bringlings who are indeed the Precursors to Fae & Less and who lived one million years before our time.  Some of this story will spoil what I have in store for the Astro Battle book proper, but since this is a work in progress things will probably change so much it won't matter.

Thank you for reading!
