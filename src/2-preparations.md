## Prepar

The three moons of Rheashashan drew closer and the hour of fertility for all bringlings  
Summoned bringlings from all over the universe to their ancient spawning grounds. 

The planet was covered with Whysans \-- the best friends and natural servants of the Bringlings \-- the Whysans tidied and organized and made every piece of the planet look to perfection for their beloved Bringling masters.

And no Whysan was more important than advisor Bey of the Kastrons and his entourage  of Whysan helpers who focused all energy on the lake of spawning. The universe had existed without incident from the Gud since the end of the 2nd Gudite war... Most thought the Guds to be dead but others shunned a life of luxury and frequently went hunting Grint.

Grints were the loyal servants of the Gudite. A meter in height with grey skin  
and baggy clothes and red beady eyes.... their most alarming feature was a long  
Witches nose and frayed mustache. Grints were to Gudites what Whysans  
were to the Bringlings.... best friend species that may not have been capable of  
betrayal due to some type of genetic engineering from the previous life.

But the Whyss were elflike and beautiful. Often they had pointy ears, blond hair, blue eyes  
every Whyss had a kind face and all lived to help a Bringling every day. In the  
service of greater utility the Whysan shared lesser magics granted by the  
Bringlings but not exceeding the power of any Bringlings.

The Whysan lifecycle was shorter and much more akin to that of the earthlings  
. They bore children the natural way and raised them in families. In later years  
male bringlings might lose their hair and grow a small gut, and bringling women  
thinned from their fertile  proportions, wrinkled a bit but remained beautiful to  
their dying day.

All over the outer atmosphere of Rheashan perfect spherical folds bloomed and from them  
small white metallic spheres called ‘carriages’ descended near the terrain of the spawning lake.  A closer look revealed some kind of fluid like a perfect transparent bubble of water that  
extended not a meter in length from the metallic surface of the carriage.   
Most odd was the size for they seemed only large enough for a single inhabitant but that was another deception of Bringling magic. For the insides of these modes of travel were lavish castles… some more vast than any planet in the galaxy.  

Rheashan was now the capital of the Bringling empire. Great works of art  
gave tribute to the Bringling ancestors who built this place and in fact built the entire universe.  For the most part all Bringling flourishes were tastefully laced with nature allowing the planet to retain her bucolic appeal. Women and young girls thronged the beaches watching strapping young men battle in the waters of the spawning lake.... such had become part of the  
Ceremony… for bringling women men beating the hell out of each other was the quintessence of sexual intrigue.

One place was off limits to all but royalty and that was the 9 steps.... So sacred  
was this place during this time that Whysan soldiers and Bringling knights  
alike shared protection duty and fended off any would-be interlopers. 

The celebration progressed, The old consumed many wines and delicacies \--  
gifts from lesser creatures. The young became more lively and flirtatious,  
playful and amorous in the lake.
