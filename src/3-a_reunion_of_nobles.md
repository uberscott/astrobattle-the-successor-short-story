###  Reunion of Nobles

Representatives of the Kastron family greeted the Noblesse as they attended the grounds of the castle with great pomp and circumstance.

In the ceremonial line of order was the Kastron family: Lady Relgus, her husband Vallus, Daughters Ugkla and Aylia fraternal twins about 14-chrons of age. Then there was Young Gomert  10-chrons-old.  Beside them stood The most respected Whysan advisor Bey who had the best knack for remembering family members' names and a master at unwinding unfavorable and embarrassing threads of conversation.

The Kastrons were surrounded by hundreds of Whysan servants and soldiers.  They were equally flanked by high level Bringling knights, Wizards and advisors.   Careful observers could see the excited eyes of Debit the Bringling squire who stood in the only place appropriate for his station–the very back.

The attendees, noble born, high ranking knights and wizards and the distinguished–recognized thinkers, authors, actors and artists–were allowed to approach and speak to the Kastron royalty for as long as they could before risk of boredom (which was often not long).  Most of the interactions involved introducing of age appropriate lads to the Kastron daughters who seemed shy and reserved in all cases.   Potential playmates for Gomert were bandied as well, but he was able to avoid playtime by virtue of being extremely introverted and weird.

As the day went along some unworthies were sent away by hand gestures from Bey.

One in attendance was an ancient knight by the name of Badius and despite great desire from Bey he could not be easily dismissed.  He was low-born and ancient and would be unwelcome on the grounds but for his heroic act of slaying the last Gudite dragon of the 2nd war or at least famous for being the last surviving person on the team that slayed that dragon.  No one knew exactly how the slaying happened. Either way Gudite dragons were the most fearsome piece on any battlefield ever it was said and the Kastrons owed a lot to someone on account of their castles and kingdoms weren’t being melted every other day for so long… This time Badius came to introduce his two great, great-grandsons Rasp and Ipsil … also paternal twins and 14 chrons in age.  The perfect match for the Kastron girls.

The Kastron daughters seemed shy yet excited to be in the presence of the young men.... They kept clandestinely stabbing the boys with little furtive glances.  The Boys saw and liked what they saw but similarly were struck with awkwardness

"MY they have grown" blurted Badius!

“Yes, and we are indeed excited to see the deeds that your boys will add to your family…”, Bey began deflection.

“I told you these girls will want a gondola ride….. Rasp!... oh wait…. You are Rasp. Rasp! Take these girls on a gondola ride right–”

“-- Sir, They really are quite tired from greeting so many…. Perhaps another time–”

“Dammit Whysan, I am Badius, slayer of Klyntar, the last dragon of the Gudite threat four thousand years ago!!!  Do not interrupt me, man!.... What was I saying?”

Badius' aggressive behavior prompted The knight Slayadon to step forward for passive protection.  Slayadon signaled for his sword.  His squire Deebit stepped forward to hand it to him if violence was needed.  All respect would be given to the old man but if in his anger he showed the slightest threat to the Kastrons he would be dead in a moment.

Reading the room, lady Relgus spoke: “I think a gondola ride would be delightful for our girls to get to know your boys”  The children consented.

Excellent! My coin… where is my coin… Trina!  My coin.  A Bringling girl in plain clothes approached and produced a golden coin good for one gondola ride.  She gave it directly to Rasp who took the coin without making eye contact.

Rasp threw the gondola coin in the air and the expected transportation phased into existence.

Slayadon: “Perhaps a chaperone might be appropriate, sire”

Urkla gave a cross look at the idea of adult supervision of any kind.  Aylia cleverly said “How about your capable squire… he can protect us from the many dangers of this world.”

“Ah yes!  My boys are quite capable, but they don’t know the planet they can use a worthy man like your squire. Trina you better go too to make sure these girls don’t bewitch my boys. Ha! Ha! Ha!”

All eye contact with Badius was broken. Bey’s forehead fell into the palm of his open hand and stayed there for a while.

Vallus just wanted the situation to be over with:  “Off you go!”  All jumped on the gondola and escaped at top speed zooming away to see the sights of Rheashan.
