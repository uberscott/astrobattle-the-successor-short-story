## TRINA IN THE DARKNESS

“Trina! Trinadon!”  Deebit shouted for his new friend.

She seemed in danger having fallen deep into the well structure and being the victim of a malicious cave in. It was dark, she was underwater a shallow pool of water  
and a boulder the size of her body pinned her to the bottom.

Such a predicament was nothing for a Bringing of any stripe as they are always imbued with many protection magics. Her flesh could not be pierced bruised, burned or  
bludgeoned by anything but a bringling weapon or spell and Aylia's attack had not been focused on her but around her.

"*Breath*," she said. And the water became breathable. "*Sight*" she said and her eyes  
pierced all darkness. "*Strength*" she said and with no effort she tossed the  
bolder aside.

She stood out of the water and discovered a rocky and windy cave path. Flanked by fertility totem generated of stone. Such things had been less interesting than slugs a moment ago but this totem seemed to grab her guts and stir the first inklings of womanhood within her.

"Trina" (Deebit now spoke in a psychic connection) Are you ok? He asked  

She noticed she had lost some blood. Impossible\!  

"I live" she replied tersely  

"I'm coming down"  

"Don't." I think this is a place only for women.  

"I don't know what to do!" Deebit said aloud.  

"No man does" This struck Deebit funny.... it was the first time she hadn't spoken to him like an age-mate.  

"I will find the Whysan Ghaedus"  

"Yes.... do that thing. In the meantime I am fine."    

Who is Ghaedus? She thought…

Compulsion swelled in her, and she walked the path of the totem. It was not a  
long path, but it was windy and with lots of artifacts... it was an ancient place  
She surmised.... not seen since the time of Rhea.  

Drops of blood came from Trina.... from the fall? impossible. It was a very  
A confusing thing. She swiped a sample with her finger and marveled at the  
beautiful crimson color. She had never bled before or seen any Bringling  
bleed.  

The blood sprang from her crotch and in checking she could find no obvious  
sign of injury. The sensation was scary and yet right to her so she persisted  
on the path.

Around the corner the journey ended and revealed a steamy grotto flanked by  
flowers and beautiful fauna it was a place for things to grow..... from the water  
refreshing steam billowed and filled the room with a warm delightful humidity.

And in the center of the grotto a shaft emerged.  It was emblazoned with ancient Bringling runes that read 'Maezir'

She looked at herself in shame.... blood covered her dress from the  
midline down. Several spells failed to rectify her bloody clothes and 
The position and magnitude of the blood seemed like it would embarrass her...

She waded into the grotto and started scrubbing her skirt like some primitive  
tribe girl. The blood washed quite effectively, but started to cloud that part of  
the water red.... a red that no seeing spell could pierce so she ventured deeper  
into the water. More washing and deeper still she reached the beam of light  
coming from the ceiling. with her task almost done she stepped in something  
that lit within her a burning want.... the want burned indeed but what she  
wanted was unclear.

She reached down to her foot and pulled from its perch a handful of bright  
red clay the likes she had never seen before. It felt better than anything  
she had ever touched. She began to knead and work the clay  
She grabbed another handful and another and then sat on a nearby rock to  
work on her new obsession.  It was more fun for her than slugs.

"We cannot find you, Trina\! What witchery is this\!" Her concerned friend  
called to her through his mind, but Trina was now completely obsessed with  
her task though she could not have told anyone WHAT she was doing. With a skill she didn't know she had, a figure began to take shape. It was a little  
person, but the proportions were all wrong. A big head. Stubby arms and legs  
and a fat little belly. Eyes larger than they should be, and shut.... a nose like a  
little button and cheeks that she wanted to take a bite from.

Then it was finished.

Trina looked at the thing she had created and joyfully wept. And these  
feelings confused her.... to love something more deeply and more completely  
than the slug she had caught just hours ago seemed impossible.

Then a shutter. Something was watching her... something with yellow eyes. She recoiled.  
"*SIGHT!*" she commanded but there was nothing there.  

"Trina\!" she heard over the psychic waves.  

She swaddled her new creation not knowing what to do with it only that she  
would now protect it with her life.

She looked up to the ceiling light and said "*Ascend*" and gravity released its  
hold on her, and she began to float to the crevice in the ceiling. As she  
approached she noticed it was the light of Kardia... the third moon shown its  
light into the grotto. She had seen Kardia as an ill formed  
potato of a celestial body, but it now seemed more like a floating and beating  
Heart.

She floated from the cave and hovered 10 meters into the Kardian moonlight cradling  
her clay thing.

"It's you\!" a figure riding a gondola came zooming to her position. "*Float!*" he  
exclaimed and leapt from the gondola to take Trina into his arms.... she allowed him to  
hug her but used one hand to protect the bundle in her other arm from being  
crushed. 

"I searched for you, I was worried Here is your slug!!!"  

Trina was content in his embrace. "Keep the slug for me for a while. I have  
something..."  

"Something you found? "  

"Something I found. Something I made. I could not have without you"  

"But... you are bleeding!" He noticed her torn skirt.  

"Not anymore I'm not. It was scary, painful and beautiful. I have never felt such  
A thing as this moment."  

Deebit guided his crazed friend to the gondola. We have to get you back. You  
need to see a doctor.
