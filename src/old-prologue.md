# The Last Words of the Previous Life

# *4,000 years before “the succession”*

One more blow and this long saga could be a mere anecdote.  But she let her foe escape to turn and hear the ruined man’s final words. 

His voice lacks air and sound carries through the spurts of blood that vomits from his mouth in fragments:

“He has killed me…  My own…”

“This calamity….  Made from my ambitions…. Now in the final I fail my creations.”

Fantastic pain splashed across his face.

“No\! No wasting of worry on my… abominations… My heart dies for my People.  The ones I betrayed…” more pain. “my children”, he said softly.  “To speak it with such reluctance\!  Can I not own my own shame?”

“Good was my desire. Do you know that…. You know that… many I lectured of \[the\] good I wrought…as if it was beyond question\! And for my *\[inaudible\]*… to repay us with such evils\!”

“Now I lay destroyed.  Smote and spilled of the last of what was my life.  Nothing left to stop them…. And still…And yet…”,  with even more effort, “***THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE IT\!***”

More he fades.

“Rhea.  My Rhea.  The task now falls to you.  It is now you… you are now the hero of this story.  It is you who must bring this world of conflict to a world of resolution… or let our world fall forever into hell.”

He weeps for a moment. His death, now quite at hand. 

“No father should hoist his ambitions…upon his child.  No child… should be tasked to undo  the folly of the father.  To do so is to stab your baby in the heart.  For my lack I beg you… forgive me, dear Rhea.”

He dies.

His body bursts into flame and is extinguished in an instant.  She reaches into the ashen pile that was her father and pulls from it a tiny stone.  She held it to her forehead and wept for a long while before starting on the path of restitution.
