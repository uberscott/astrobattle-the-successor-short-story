## COUNCIL WITH THE KASTRONS

Modus crashed the gondola through Deebit's prison window.

Trina screamed.

The Gondola began to dissolve into smoke, revealing a disheveled Deebit

Deebit was flustered but  blushed when he saw Trina.

"You have come to rescue me?" He asked.

"No, but I need you... and she needs you. Deebit loyal servant of the Kastrons... Do not ask questions for our time is little."

Modus, from his coat produced a mask and handed it to Deebit. "Wear this.  
The guards and staff will not make notice of you so long as you don't speak or  
touch anything but her.

“Take Trina to the thrown room and have her petition Vallus, master of the Kastron family for council.

“Deebit must NOT speak at this time for any reason. Kastron will refuse any request, but don't overdo it, Trina. You will be there to buy time until Kastron's bound Whysan Advisor Bey arrives. I will have spoken to him by that time and made him believe that your child is something the Kastrons must have.

"Baby" Deebit looked at Trina.

"Don't speak or think, Deebit." Modus reminded. "Just show her the way and act  
as her anonymous escort.

Modus opened the cell door without force or key.

"How?", said Deebit.

"Deebit, really, if anyone else is in the room and you talk again the illusion will  
break and they will run you through. And if you try to think again I'll run you  
Through."

Guards were frantically approaching.

Now for some more smoke. Modus exhaled a torrent of thick black smoke. The  
shade made nothing visible. "The Eyes of Modus" Modus commanded and all three  
escapees could see through the smoke like it was no more than a darkened  
haze. They ran past three sets of confused guards shouting "Eyes\! Eyes\! the  
Eyes\!" but Modus' enchantment was too strong for their weak magic.  
"Fulfill your mission kids. I will meet you in the throne room AND don't drop  
that baby\!"

The great conjunction was nearly upon this world and all in the house of the  
Kastrons lingered on the balcony waiting to see the celestial artistry of Rhea  
Unfold.

Villus Kastron addressed his family, "She really was quite the artist our  
Ancestor"

Lady Roleta his wife added: someday a Kastron descendant will be born from  
this land and create works and worlds the likes even the previous life would be  
in awe to witness."

"Well, its not going to be Urka or Aylia's year to produce an heir what with what  
Deebit did with their hair and clothes.

Roleta asked, what do you think of that, my son? Could it be you?  Could you be the heir? Technically luna can select any child born during a lesser conjunction so long as it was not before a previous conjunction"

Vallus, “That’s somewhat of a stretch of the rules… who knows”

Gomert relished the praise from his parents. "I will be the greatest artists of  
any universe one day.... I will make the first super rift between worlds, a planet  
rich in oriculoum--"

Some inappropriate noise from the direction of the thrown room bothered  
them a little.

"I want to make the first planetary ecosystem where each species comes from  
a different pla--"

More disturbance.

Gomert annoyed: "Whysan what is this commotion?

A flustered Whysan servant entered and reported: "A commoner and her whysan escort  
wish to speak to the Lord”

"At this time\!" Villus snarked, "The conjunction is about to happen.... we could  
have a new queen"

At that instance two door guards were parted. They fell to the ground and their  
mighty halyards crashed and clanged. Villus spit out his wine. Gomert pissed  
his pants \-- the conjunction party was officially ruined by this final event.  
But the ruiner was Chief advisor Bey.... Villus's whysan companion, respected  
by all in the house of Kastron. If he felt the need to do some guard tipping  
people thought there must be a good reason and there was.  
My lord, I speak quickly for opportunity and time.

I will explain and you must decide quickly: Outside I have discovered an  
extraordinary woman. She has modeled a living stone baby from the forbidden  
clay. And moreover this baby is a trimind.   
I needed remind you of the  
greatness of the last Bringling duomind who still changes our world to this day.

The baby lacks paternal breath and the mother is mateless and unmarried.

I do not deceive in saying that a trimind in the Kastron family would surely give  
you the throne of Rhea you so desire. I also cannot deceive in saying that  
breathing life into a trimind is tricky and the child may die either way.  But we are not completely out of our depth… for our alchemist has recreated the unction of binding…. The same unction that saved the infant lives of Calcus and Kashic, the two greatest minds of this Bringling universe.

So here it is:  Make this woman a Kastron.  Mary her to your son Gomert.   
Give this stone orb your family's breath and make it into your grand child. The child will be the greatest asset to the Kastron name if not the Rhea’s successor herself”

Deebit fidgeted with his mask, but said nothing. The masks enchantment made  
him seem an uninteresting commoner that wasn't worth looking at.... but the  
slightest attention would break the illusion.

The conjunction ticked ever so closer... time was almost up.

There you have it my lord.  Choose wisely, but choose quickly.

Vallus acted with religion.  “Woman your name?”

“Trinadon” she replied.

“Lady Trinadon you and your baby are now a Kastron and Gomert here is your wedded husband (Bringling courting rituals could be very terse)

“Take it Gomert.”

Gomert pensively walked to Trina… his urine filled pants made a squishing sound.

I will say the words, you will copy me and you will fill the air.

Lord Villus took the orb and examined each face in turn. He spoke to all: We  
need a warrior, a wizard and a great leader to succeed just as our ancestor  
Rhea.

He handed the orb back to Gomert.

He turned to the first face. Her eyes slowly opened. My child take from me  
my talents, my ability to lead and protect the things we hold dear.... fulfill that  
which I cannot and make the Kastrons a greater name than ever before...  
Her eyes slowly closed and her mouth opened.

Gomert then kissed the mouth and slowly exhaled a baby's volume of air.  The course grains of the stone became soft and a little flexible... then the mouth exhaled and closed.

Gomert turned the stone to the next face. His eyes slowly opened and viewed  
him with sleepy suspicion. Take your marshal inspiration from the moon  
Mikkatra .... make its power our own. Fight the defend house Kastron and fight  
those that stand in the way of our wants....His eyes slowly closed and his mouth opened. Gomert then kissed his mouth and slowly exhaled a baby's breath. The mouth closed and The face twitched a little and a fleshy color started to flow into the orb like blood was pulsing for  
the first time.

Gomert turned the warm and softened stone one more time Her eyes opened  
very little. look to the sky and see our ancestor Harkus Kastron, the wizard  
companion of Rhea herself. Many a Gudite contrivance did he foil. Be the wit  
and winning tactician of the Kastron family.  
Her eyes slowly closed and her mouth gently opened. Gomert pressed his lips  
and forced the last bit of life…but then… nothing happened. The mouth did not close  
and no change could be detected.

What is this, Bey. What has gone wrong. Wait sire. Wait. Give it a moment.

Gomert handed the baby to Trina like it was some type of a deceased frog.  And made some distance.

Nothing like this has ever happened before.

The Klaxon began to sound… the great conjunction was soon to be upon Rheashan.

A little sound came from the mouth... like a burp.

And this caused Gomerts curiosity to grow so he came in for a closer look.

Tiny arms started to sprout from every angle six in all.... and they began to move in little baby like jolts. Still the last baby's mouth was open as if it had not yet accepted the breath.

"Will it be normal? Gomert asked showing a little buyer's remorse"

"Of course I think so sir" Bey answered rubbing his neck line.

Urksa and Aylia summoned by the commotion joined the family on the balcony.  Urksa wore a very concealing hat.

The baby grew a little more and the three heads started to differentiate a little. And still the third baby's mouth remained opened

“How revolting”, Urksa gave her editorial.

The baby will split into three, give it time.

“It will not.” Trina said… she knew it to be true, but did not know how she knew…. Still to her the process was going normally except for the 3rd head which worried her greatly.

And yet the blob seemed to be trying to divide into three…. And tension eased the more the unusual baby seemed to be splitting into three normal babies.

"Wait a minute. I know this girl\! She is the commoner from house Plumper." Urka blurted.

"A slave\! We cannot accept an slave into the Kastron family\! Aylia added.

"Give me that baby" Urka took the baby from Trina's meek and frightened  
Hands…

"Begone commoner, you have no claim to this baby", Aylia commanded. Gomert laughed at this  
Tears flowed of Trina's eyes, she looked to Deebit for support which drew Urka's  
attention to him. "Wait a minute\! It's Deebit...they are servants of Modus\!  Cast them out.

Then a change occurred in the baby.... the third babies eyes opened again  
and quite widely.... the other two seemed distressed and writhed as if in pain. Gomert took his newly forming child and looked at the third face closely .... they  
made eye contact for sure \-- a very unusual thing for a newborn baby to do and  
then a deep belch emitted from the mouth exciting laughter at first until the mouth began to spray black vomit... lots of it all over  Gomert. At the same time the baby became more like stone and Gomert dropped it spewing black vomit all over the floor, walls, ceiling furniture and the Kastrons themselves.

The volume of vomit waned and halted and then the baby closed her mouth  
and eyes. The little hands were reabsorbed and all seemed like the orb had  
completely returned to stone save for disturbed expressions on the other two  
faces. Expressions that Bey said meant they were trying to live but being  
suppressed by face number three.

The unction\!  Pour the unction in the 3rds mouth…. Where is the uncion (chaos do to slippery black liquid caused the unction to be completely lost(

Aylia said, "Its the third head.... cut it before it kills the other two. " She lunged  
for the head which slipped from her hands because of all the black liquid  
Everywhere.

And that was it for Deebit. With rage he doffed his disguise with intent to use his  
sub elementary battle skills to save the child he now felt a cosmic connection to. Cosmic connections don't actually give a person any advantage in a fight. Rooms filled with slippery goo help a lot if your instinct is to stand still because  
you are too terrified to fight. .

Guards and family alike attempted to take from Deebit but were equally stifled by the slipperyness of the black liquid.  And then it was upon them.... the final klakson of the great conjunction.... This baby would be brought to life in the next few seconds or die forever.

Deebit remained still and pondered his options at light speed: He couldn’t fight because he was a legendary weakling, He couldn't run because he would slip and fall. He couldn't wait because eventually they would get a polearm or something and beat him to death.... He couldn't slide  
because... wait a minute. He COULD slide and he did slide right off the railing  
of the balcony. He was a bringling after all and would be safe falling 10 stories  
and tumbling down a thornly hill. It wasn't fun but that's what he did to escape.

He crashed in a thornbush and lost the baby stone for a few moments he  
frantically felt around and said "Seek" and pow, there it was.  
Far above him he could hear commotion... most likely Vallus and Gormet  
commanding some Whysan guards to sacrifice their lives to punish Deebit, but  
they would be too late.

Deebit composed himself for a moment... he looked at the defiant face that had  
rejected Gohmert and her eyes opened for him.

Then he spoke HIS words:  I give you…. MY heart. I give it to  
you so it will be YOUR heart. You will do what you will with your own heart and  
I will love you whatever you become.

The baby's eyes closed and mouth opened.

Nervously, Deebit leaned over and pressed his lips to the infant’s face. He gave his breath and withdrew.... She closed her mouth and her cheeks puffed and flushed a little red.

The stone became flesh and the flesh began to transform.  
The two other heads retracted into the babies innards ... they looked content ...  
not to be reabsorbed but somehow they were being made into one being  
instead of three.

A plump little torso began to balloon from her neck and golden hair curled from  
the top of her head.

Everything else on a baby eventually sprung to life including 2 arms 2 legs ,  
fingers, toes and naughty parts. It was a little girl, pink and perfect.  
Deebit wept.

Then in an instant the baby transformed into a completely different child.... this  
time a slightly larger boy with white hair.

And again the baby made a third transformation and was a completely new girl  
with platinum hair and a pixie cut.

"A trimind" Modus said. He had been standing behind Deebit for a while. "One  
body that shares three minds and the ability to switch to whichever body suits  
Them."

Quick… give her this: He held the magic unction.

In uncharacteristic fashion Deebit swatted the unction away.  “No\!  They don’t need it… I know this\!”

On the balcony Urkla was nonplussed.  “He made a fool of us. Look, he doesn't even have any of the black stuff on him. Use him as a mop.”

It seemed no magic spell could rid them of the black goo which had gone from  
slippery to sticky.

Vallus released his rage, “ How DARE you make a fool of my family.  You are no doubt bound to this Wysan trouble maker Modus\!   
Of course this marriage is now annulled you little slut." Urksa added. "Father  
wasted the last of the unction of Joining on your pathetic monster."

"She bewitched me into marriage" Gomert lamented.

"That can be fixed, but we can't let her or that child--if it lives-- ever lay claim to  
the Kastron name." Aylia posited.

"I say this with authority that supercedes all others as Vallus leader of house Kastron not even anything I have said or will ever say can change the words of this proclomation--" this was the way official documents were created amongst the bringlings--"You are no Kastron and never have been. It is official and unrevokable that neither you nor your abomination shall ever carry  
the name Kastron.  My words are final."

Vallus gave Urksa a look... she prepped her knife and approached Trinadon…

But before she could slash her throat the loudest klaxon of all sounded and  
exotic lights of all kinds flashed into the insides of the castle.

The Conjunction\! Vallus gasped.... All ran to the balcony careful to avoid the  
black goo in which two Whysan's seemed permanently stuck.  
A moment of awe passed over all on planet Rheashashan. Luna's shine was always the  
same but it was very different this time.... light spilled from the celestial body  
and seemed to wind and weave all over the planet a light that was not only  
pretty but a kind that seemed to add something to the very soul of the  
observer. The experience of the light is not something that can actually be  
described in words.

To many it was an explicit sign of the first SELECTION moon....

Typically during this experience all parents held their new babies to the sky as  
they wailed in fear... it was believed the crying was good for the lungs of all  
babies even the ones that didn't become the rulers of the universe on the day  
they were born. But mass fear caused mothers to hold their new infants very  
close to their breasts.

And then the sound stopped and all heard the voice of Rhea speaking to them  
from Luna. "You have spoken the words and you have spoken them rightly." And then the moon exploded back into its three component moons and the  
two largest returned to their orbits... but small and red moon Kardia seemed to be making planetfall.  if anything it got larger and.... it was actually tumbling to the planet.  
Bringlings are robust but no creature in the universe is unafraid of a celestial  
object dropping directly on his face. Mass hysteria broke out.

Trina--moments from having her throat slit--suddenly felt gravitational pull  
of her heart change. Her worries lifted and her body itself began to favor the  
approaching moon. She started to be pulled to the falling moon and on the way  
a tiny thing flew from the ground and into her arms... it was her new baby....  
alive, fully formed and perfect to her happy water gushed from her eyes as they  
spun in a circle on a date with whatever.

Trina held her laughing baby to the sky just as they intercepted the small  
moon, which was not solid, but a soft and cool plasma... like a red heart shaped bubble  
that absorbed mother and child and then squeezed something into them.

And to them and only them Rhea spoke one last time: Listen to others and  
vanquish your foe. Listen to YOUR heart and have no foe to vanquish"  
Then Rhea spoke again so the general public can hear: Now.... say your names:  
"I am Trinadon Wusk of the lost Wuskians.... she held her laughing baby in the  
sky "And here I present Tres, Dyad and Monoli of the Wuskian trimind\!"

Rhea "my chair and my gifts are yours for safe keeping for a while queen regent  
Wusk, choose wisely when you choose to pass them along"  
Then the red membrane of kardia swelled and finally it burst like a gooey souflet.

Gravity reestablished its old relationship with Trina and she fell slowly like the planet itself cradled her and her baby with gentle and loving hands.   But when she touched the ground a massive explosion was released but she was now blessed with Rhea's gifts and no thing, person or object could hurt her. She was the most powerful thing in the universe.  They all were Lady Trinadon, Tres, DyAd and little Monoli.
