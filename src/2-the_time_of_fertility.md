## The Time of Fertility
#### *Four thousand years after the fall of Rhea*

On the planet Rheashan three moons drew close and the first Klaxon rang. It was not a mortal sound that spread its noise through vibrations in the air, but a sound made of Bringling magic that vibrated space faster than light itself.  Bringlings and their servants perceived the 'sound' and knew it summoned them for The Time of Fertility--the ritual of Bringling reproduction and the only way Bringling reproduction was possible in this the universe of resolution.

It had been ten Chrons since the last ritual.  The Fertility season did not happen every year and in fact its occurrence was not predictable by the Bringlings which put a great urgency into the hearts of all Bringlings who desired children.

Whysans planetwide became busied with preparations. They tidied and organized and made every piece of the planet look to perfection for their beloved Bringlings.  

Whysans were the humanoid 'best friend' species of the Bringlings.  They were smaller of frame elflike, beautiful and always with a kind face. 
Many Whysans were bound to a particular Bringling and lived to make that Bringling happy every day. 

The Whysan people shared lesser magics granted by their Bringling masters but not exceeding the power of any Bringling--at least in most cases.

No Whysan was more important than advisor Bey of the Kastrons and his entourage of Whysan helpers who focused all energy on the lake of spawning. 

The universe had existed without incident from the Gud since the end of the 2nd Gudite war... Most thought the Gudlings to be dead but others shunned a life of luxury and frequently went hunting Grint.

Grints were the loyal servants of the Gudite. A meter in height with grey skin  
and baggy clothes and red beady eyes.... their most alarming feature was a long  
Witches nose and frayed mustache. Grints were to Gudites what Whysans  
were to the Bringlings.... best friend species that may not have been capable of  
betrayal due to some type of genetic engineering from the previous life.

The Whysan lifecycle was shorter and much more akin to that of a human's
. They bore children the natural way and raised them in families. In later years  
male Whysans might lose their hair and grow a small gut, and Whysan women  
thinned from their fertile  proportions, wrinkled a bit but remained beautiful to  
their dying day.

All over the outer atmosphere of Rheashan perfect spherical spatial folds bloomed and from them  
small white metallic spheres called ‘carriages’ descended near the spawning lake.     
The size of these vehicles seemed odd for they seemed only large enough for a single inhabitant but that was another deception of Bringling magic. The insides of these modes of travel were lavish castles… some more vast than any planet in the galaxy.  

Rheashan was now the capital of the Bringling empire. Great works of art  
gave tribute to the Bringling ancestors who built this place and in fact built the entire universe.  For the most part all Bringling flourishes were tastefully laced with nature allowing the planet to retain her bucolic appeal. Women and young girls thronged the beaches watching strapping young men battle in the waters of the spawning lake.... such had become part of the  
Ceremony… for bringling women men beating the hell out of each other was the quintessence of sexual intrigue.

The celebration progressed, The old consumed many wines and delicacies \--  
gifts from lesser creatures. The young became more lively and flirtatious,  
playful and amorous in the lake.
